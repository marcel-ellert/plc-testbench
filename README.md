# PLCTestbench

PLCTestbench is a companion tool for researchers and developers working on Packet Loss Concealment (PLC). It greatly simplifies the process of measuring the reconstruction quality of PLC algorithms and allows to easily test the effects of different packet loss models and distributions.

It features the implementation of some of the most common packet loss models, PLC algorithms and metrics:

**Packet Loss Simulation**
- **Binomial**: uniform distribution of packet losses, governed by the Packet Error Ratio (PER) parameter.
- **Metronome**: periodic packet losses governed by the burst period, the burst length, and an offset.
- **Gilbert-Elliot**: bursty distribution of packet losses, governed by the four probabilities associated to its two states (For each state, the probability of packet loss and the probability of transitioning to the other state) [[1](#1)].

**PLC Algorithms**
- **Zeros**: the lost samples are replaced by zeros.
- **Last Packet**: the lost samples are replaced by the last received packet.
- **Low-Cost**: implementation of the algorithm proposed in [[2](#2)].
- **Burg**: Python bindings for the [C++ implementation of the Burg method](https://github.com/matteosacchetto/burg-implementation-experiments).
- **Deep Learning**: implementation of the algorithm proposed in [[3](#3)].
- **Advanced**: allows to apply different PLC algorithms to different frequency bands and audio channels (M/S processing included).
- **External**: Python bindings for C++ to simplify the integration of existing algorithms.

**Metrics**
- **Mean Square Error**: the mean square error between the original and reconstructed signal.
- **Mean Amplitude Error**: the mean amplitude error between the original and reconstructed signal.
- **PEAQ**: the Perceptual Evaluation of Audio Quality (PEAQ) metric, as defined in [[4](#4)].
- **Windowed PEAQ**: PEAQ with a specific window length.
- **Spectral Energy Difference**: Difference of spectral energy between the original and reconstructed signal. (Currenty not usable)
- **Human**: this metric produces the config file for a MUSHRA test using as stimuli excerpts of the reconstructed audio tracks. It also gathers the results of the test to be displayed alongside the other metrics.
- **Perceptual**: perceptually-motivated evaluation metric for Packet Loss Concealment in Networked Music Performances, as defined in [[5](#5)]

## Usage
You use the testbench with a Jupyter Notebook. How to use it is explained in the next steps.

### Startup and Initializing

If you have done the installation directly before, skip this point. Otherwise activate ubuntu, the virtual environment venv310 and mongodb.
```bash
    wsl -d ubuntu
    source venv310/bin/activate
    podman start mongodb
```

The file `plctestbench.ipynb` contains a Jupyter Notebook. Navigate to it and start the Juypter Notebook.
```bash
    jupyter notebook
```

Copy and paste one of the URLs to a browser. Click on `plctestbench.ipynb`. This file contains examples and explanations of how to use the tool.
Change the path to your root folder named `input_files`.
```python/jupyter notebook
    testbench_settings = {
        'root_folder': 'path/to/root/folder',
        'db_ip': 'ip.of.the.database',
        'db_port': 27017,
        'db_username': 'myUserAdmin',
        'db_password': 'admin',
    }
```
Put the audio files to be analyzed in this folder and list them as follows (path relative to `root_folder`):
```python/jupyter notebook
    original_audio_tracks = [(OriginalAudio, OriginalAudioSettings('Blues_Drums.wav')),
                            (OriginalAudio, OriginalAudioSettings('Blues_Piano.wav'))]
```
Afterwards you can set up the testbench settings by commenting in/out and/or changing the setup to your specific needs.
The format is adapted in `plctestbench.ipynb` so that simple commenting out and commenting in is possible. Here, however, it is shortened for reasons of clarity.
To start the testbench you need to click on the Icon with two arrows pointing to the right.
You will find both the audio files and the results in the folder specified in `input_files`.

Important Information: The DeepLearningPLC algorithm requires the `packet_size` to be set to 128 in the `Settings` of the `PacketLossSimulator` of choice.
See the example below.
```python/jupyter notebook
    packet_loss_simulators = [(BinomialPLS, BinomialPLSSettings(packet_size = 128))]
```

### Fade in/Crossfade

When a packet is lost, the PLC algorithm has to reconstruct the lost samples. However, the reconstructed samples are not going to be identical to the original ones. A fade in/crossfade feature allows to gradually transition from the original samples to the reconstructed ones, and vice versa. This works by creating two vectors from 0 to 1 depending on the selected function. These are multiplied by the original and the reconstructed samples. Finally, the power or amplitude is adjusted.

The crossfade can be customized in the following aspects:
- **Length**: duration of the crossfade in milliseconds.
- **Function**: function to use:
    - **Power**: crossfade is $x^n$.
    - **Sinusoidal**: crossfade is sinusoidal ($\sin\left(x\right)$ for $0 < x < \frac{\pi}{2}$).
- **Exponent**: exponent of the power crossfade function.
- **Type**:
    - **Equal Power**: sum of the squares of the two crossfades equals 1.
    - **Equal Amplitude**: sum of the two crossfades equals 1.

The fade in/crossfade can be applied to the left or the right of the lost samples, or both. The following example illustrates how to configure the settings to use these.
```python
    crossfade_settings = (ManualCrossfadeSettings(length = 1, function = 'power', exponent = 1.0, type = 'power'))
    
    plc_algorithms = [(ZerosPLC, ZerosPLCSettings(fade_in = crossfade_settings, crossfade = crossfade_settings))]
```
As shown in the previous example, the `fade_in` parameter determines the crossfade to apply to the left of the lost samples, while the `crossfade` parameter determines the crossfade to apply to the right of the lost samples.

Important Information: The length of `fade_in` cannot be greater than the length of the lost packet.

The `ManualCrossfadeSettings` class allows to manually set the parameters of the crossfade.
However, there are other convenience classes that are pre-set to some common configurations.
- `NoCrossfadeSettings`: disables the crossfade.
- `LinearCrossfadeSettings`: applies a linear crossfade (`function` = 'power' and `exponent` = 1.0).
- `QuadraticCrossfadeSettings`: applies a quadratic crossfade (`function` = 'power' and `exponent` = 2.0).
- `CubicCrossfadeSettings`: applies a cubic crossfade (`function` = 'power' and `exponent` = 3.0).
- `SinusoidalCrossfadeSettings`: applies a sinusoidal crossfade (`function` = 'sinusoidal').

You will find them in `plctestbench.ipynb`.
Both the `fade_in` and `crossfade` parameters always default to `NoCrossfadeSettings` so that the crossfade is disabled by default.

### Multiband Crossfade (not updated yet)

Different crossfade settings can be applied to different frequency bands. This can be useful mitigate some of the artifacts introduced by the crossfade.

This is an example configuration for three bands crossfade:
```python
    multiband_crossfade_settings = \
        [MultibandSettings(frequencies = [200, 2000]),
         QuadraticCrossfadeSettings(length=50),
         QuadraticCrossfadeSettings(length=5),
         QuadraticCrossfadeSettings(length=1)]

    (ZerosPLC, ZerosPLCSettings(crossfade=multiband_crossfade_settings))
```
The `MultibandSettings` class allows to specify the frequencies of the bands. The first frequency is the upper bound of the first band, while the last frequency is the lower bound of the last band. The number of frequencies determines the number of bands.

The list beginning with the `MultibandSettings` class contains the crossfade settings for each band. The first element of the list is the crossfade settings for the first band, the second element is the crossfade settings for the second band, and so on. The length of the list must be equal to the number of bands.

Each band can have its own crossfade settings, totally unrelated to the other bands.

### Advanced PLC (not updated yet)

The `AdvancedPLC` object allow for two complex beheviours simultaneously:
- **Multiband PLC**: different PLC algorithms can be applied to different frequency bands. 
- **Spatial PLC**: different PLC algorithms can be applied to different audio channels (featuring M/S processing).

An example configuration of the settings to achieve such beheaviours is the following:
```python
    frequencies = {'mid': [200, 2000], 'side': [1000]}
    band_settings = {\
        'mid':
            [(ZerosPLC, ZerosPLCSettings()),
             (BurgPLC, BurgPLCSettings(order=512)),
             (BurgPLC, BurgPLCSettings(order=256))],
        'side':
            [(LastPacketPLC, LastPacketPLCSettings()),
             (BurgPLC, BurgPLCSettings(order=256))]}

    (AdvancedPLC, AdvancedPLCSettings(band_settings, frequencies = frequencies, channel_link=False, stereo_image_processing = StereoImageType.MID_SIDE))
```
The `frequencies` parameter is a dictionary that maps the name of the channel to a list of frequencies.

The `band_settings` parameter is a dictionary that maps the name of the channel to a list of tuples. Each tuple contains the PLC algorithm to apply to the band and its settings. The length of each list must be equal to the number of bands of that channel.

If L/R or M/S channels require different PLC algorithms, the `channel_link` parameter needs to be set to `False` and the related settings need to be specified in the `band_settings` parameter using the `left` and `right` or `mid` and `side` keys.

Alternatively, if the same PLC algorithms need to be applied to both channels (regardless of the L/R or M/S coding), the `channel_link` parameter needs to be set to `True` and the related settings need to be specified in the `band_settings` parameter using the `linked` key.
